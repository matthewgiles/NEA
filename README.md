# NEA
A-Level Computing NEA project. Admin management system for a dance company.

This was the first large project I ever completed. Definitely not how I would do it a second time around.

## Disclaimers
We were advised against using SQL so the database is constructed using Python objects.

The GUI is constructed using tkinter - which isn't fun! The main file is GUI.py.
